Cosc420 (Deep Learning) Projects

The source code for the Cosc420 paper is Cv_project, which contains code for classification and regression models for the smallNorb dataset. The diffusion directory also contains the code for a Unet model and the training procedure, which will generate new images once trained.

To run the code, you must download the smallNorb dataset from https://cs.nyu.edu/ylclab/data/norb-v1.0/ and add the 6 files to a folder labelled data.
